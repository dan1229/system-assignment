### This project is aiming to model a topic I feel very strongly about - Education
### I truly believe that education is one of the most important parts not just of an individual's life but of society as a whole. Having the right educational opportunities and the ability to fully pursue that education I truly believe can make or break a person's life and career. This has obvious and lasting effects on society at large.
### Each of the 'nodes' represents an issue/cause I see and each 'edge' represents how they're related. Every single edge has a popup with a description, statistics and often more reading about that specific relationship.
### This graph is only in relation to US education (at the beginning of 2021) and for brevity's sake is limited in scope. I hope you enjoy!
